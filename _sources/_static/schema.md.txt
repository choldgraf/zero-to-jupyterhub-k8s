# Helm Chart Schema

The [JupyterHub helm chart](https://github.com/jupyterhub/helm-chart). is configurable so that you can customize your Kubernetes setup however you'd like. You can extend user resources, build off of different Docker images, manage security and authentication, and more.

Below is a description of the fields that are exposed with the JupyterHub helm chart. For more detailed information about some specific things you can do with modifications to the helm chart, see the [extending jupyterhub](extending-jupyterhub.html) and
[user experience](user-experience.html) pages.
