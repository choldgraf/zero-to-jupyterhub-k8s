Getting started with JupyterHub
===============================

The goal of **JupyterHub** is to create custom computing environments that
can be accessed remotely (e.g., at a specific URL) by multiple users.

This guide acts as an assistant to guide you through the process of setting
up your JupyterHub deployment. It helps you connect and configure the
following things:

* A **cloud provider** such Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon EC2, and
  others
* **Kubernetes** to manage resources on the cloud
* **Helm** to configure and control Kubernetes
* **Docker** to use containers that standardize computing environments
* **JupyterHub** to manage users and deploy Jupyter notebooks

To get started, we recommend beginning with the first item on our
:ref:`main page <creating-your-jupyterhub>`. If you'd like to know how to
expand and customize your jupyterhub setup, check out
:ref:`extending-jupyterhub`. Finally, for a more extensive description of the
tools and services that JupyterHub utilizes, see our 
:ref:`tools` page.

If you have questions or suggestions, please reach out at our `issues page`_
on GitHub.
