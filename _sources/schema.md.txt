# Helm Chart Schema

The [JupyterHub helm chart](https://github.com/jupyterhub/helm-chart). is configurable so that you can customize your Kubernetes setup however you'd like. You can extend user resources, build off of different Docker images, manage security and authentication, and more.

Below is a description of the fields that are exposed with the JupyterHub helm chart.
For more detailed information about some specific things you can do with
modifications to the helm chart, see the [extending jupyterhub](extending-jupyterhub.html)
and [user experience](user-experience.html) pages.
## hub

### hub.cookieSecret

A 64-byte cryptographically secure randomly generated string used to sign values of
secure cookies set by the hub. If unset, jupyterhub will generate one on startup and
save it in the file `jupyterhub_cookie_secret` in the `/srv/jupyterhub` directory of
the hub container. Value set here will override the value in `jupyterhub_cookie_secret`.

You do not need to set this at all if you are using the default configuration for
storing databases - sqlite on a persistent volume (with `hub.db.type` set to the
default `sqlite-pvc`). If you are using an external database, then you must set this
value explicitly - or your users will keep getting logged out each time the hub pod
restarts.

This must be generated with `openssl rand -hex 32`.

Changing this value will all user logins to be invalidated. If this secret leaks,
*immediately* change it to something else, or user data can be compromised


### hub.imagePullPolicy

Set the imagePullPolicy on the hub pod.

See [the kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#updating-images)
for more info on what the values mean.


### hub.image

Set custom image name / tag for the hub pod.

Use this to customize which hub image is used. Note that you must use a version of
the hub image that was bundled with this particular version of the helm-chart - using
other images might not work.


#### hub.image.name

Name of the image, without the tag.

Examples:
  - yuvipanda/wikimedia-hub
  - gcr.io/my-project/my-hub


#### hub.image.tag

The tag of the image to pull.

This is the value after the `:` in your full image name.


### hub.db

#### hub.db.type

Type of database backend to use for the hub database.

The Hub requires a persistent database to function, and this lets you specify
where it should be stored.

The various options are:

1. **sqlite-pvc**

   Use an `sqlite` database kept on a persistent volume attached to the hub.

   By default, this disk is dynamically created using the default
   [dynamic provisioner]. You can customize how this disk is created / attached
   by setting various properties under `hub.db.pvc`.

   This is the default setting, and should work well for most cloud provider
   deployments.

2. **sqlite-memory**

   Use an in-memory `sqlite` database. This should only be used for testing,
   since the database is erased whenever the hub pod restarts - causing the hub
   to lose all memory of users who had logged in before.

   When using this for testing, make sure you delete all other objects that the
   hub has created (such as user pods, user PVCs, etc) every time the hub restarts.
   Otherwise you might run into errors about duplicate resources.

3. **mysql**

   Use an externaly hosted mysql database.

   You have to specify an sqlalchemy connection string for the mysql database you
   want to connect to in `hub.db.url` if using this option.

   The general format of the connection string is:
   ```
   mysql+pymysql://<db-username>:<db-password>@<db-hostname>:<db-port>/<db-name>
   ```

   The user specified in the connection string must have the rights to create
   tables in the database specified.

   Note that if you use this, you *must* also set `hub.cookieSecret`.

4. **postgres**

   Use an externaly hosted postgres database.

   You have to specify an sqlalchemy connection string for the postgres database you
   want to connect to in `hub.db.url` if using this option.

   The general format of the connection string is:
   ```
   postgres+psycopg2://<db-username>:<db-password>@<db-hostname>:<db-port>/<db-name>
   ```

   The user specified in the connection string must have the rights to create
   tables in the database specified.

   Note that if you use this, you *must* also set `hub.cookieSecret`.


#### hub.db.pvc

##### hub.db.pvc.annotations

Annotations to apply to the PVC containing the sqlite database.

TODO: Link to pvc annotations


##### hub.db.pvc.selector

Selectors to set for the PVC containing the sqlite database.

Useful when you are using a static PVC.

TODO: Link to pvc selector docs.


##### hub.db.pvc.storage

Size of disk to request for the database disk.


#### hub.db.url

Connection string when `hub.db.type` is mysql or postgres.

See documentation for `hub.db.type` for more details on the format of this property.


### hub.labels

Extra labels to add to the hub pod.

See [the kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/)
to learn more about labels.


### hub.extraEnv

Extra environment variables that should be set for the hub pod.

A dictionary of key value pairs (both strings), where the key is the name of the
environment value and the value is the value of the environment variable that should
be set on the hub pod.

These are usually used in two circumstances:
  - Passing parameters to some custom code specified with `extraConfig`
  - Passing parameters to an authenticator or spawner that can be directly customized
    by environment variables (rarer)


### hub.extraConfig

Arbitrary extra python based configuration that should be in `jupyterhub_config.py`.

This is the *escape hatch* - if you want to configure JupyterHub to do something specific
that is not present here as an option, you can just write the raw Python to do it here.

Non-exhaustive examples of things you can do here:
  - Subclass authenticator / spawner to do a custom thing
  - Dynamically launch different images for different sets of images
  - Inject an auth token from GitHub authenticator into user pod
  - Anything else you can think of!

Since this is usually a multi-line string, you want to format it using YAML's
[| operator](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2795688).

For example:
  ```
  hub:
    extraConfig: |
      c.JupyterHub.something = 'something'
      c.Spawner.somethingelse = 'something else'
  ```

No validation of this python is performed! If you make a mistake here, it will probably
manifest as either the hub pod going into `Error` or `CrashLoopBackoff` states, or in
some special cases, the hub running but... just doing very random things. Be careful!


### hub.uid

The UID the hub process should be running as.
Use this only if you are building your own image & know that a user with this uid exists inside the hub container! Advanced feature, handle with care!
Defaults to 1000, which is the uid of the `jovyan` user that is present in the default hub image.

### hub.fsGid

The gid the hub process should be using when touching any volumes mounted.
Use this only if you are building your own image & know that a group with this gid exists inside the hub container! Advanced feature, handle with care!
Defaults to 1000, which is the uid of the `jovyan` user that is present in the default hub image.

## proxy

### proxy.secretToken

A 64-byte cryptographically secure randomly generated string used to secure communications
between the hub and the configurable-http-proxy.

This must be generated with `openssl rand -hex 32`.

Changing this value will cause the proxy and hub pods to restart. It is good security
practice to rotate these values over time. If this secret leaks, *immediately* change
it to something else, or user data can be compromised


## singleuser

Options for customizing the environment that is provided to the users after they log in.


### singleuser.cpu

Set CPU limits & guarantees that are enforced for each user.

TODO: Link to k8s docs about CPU limits and guarantees.


#### singleuser.cpu.limit

#### singleuser.cpu.guarantee

### singleuser.memory

Set Memory limits & guarantees that are enforced for each user.

TODO: Link to k8s docs about Memory limits and guarantees.


#### singleuser.memory.limit

#### singleuser.memory.guarantee

### singleuser.image

Set custom image name / tag used for spawned users.

This image is used to launch the pod for each user.


#### singleuser.image.name

Name of the image, without the tag.

Examples:
  - yuvipanda/wikimedia-hub-user
  - gcr.io/my-project/my-user-image


#### singleuser.image.tag

The tag of the image to use.

This is the value after the `:` in your full image name.
