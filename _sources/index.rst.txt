Zero to JupyterHub
==================

`JupyterHub`_ is a tool that allows you to quickly utilize cloud computing
infrastructure to manage a hub that enables users to interact remotely
with a computing environment that you specify. JupyterHub offers a useful way
to standardize the computing environment of a group of people (e.g.,
for a class of students or an analytics team), as well as allowing
people to access the
hub remotely.

This growing collection of information will help you set up your own
JupyterHub instance. It is in an early stage, so the information and
tools may change quickly. If you see anything that is incorrect or have any
questions, feel free to reach out at the `issues page`_.

Creating your JupyterHub
------------------------

This is a short walkthrough starting from square one. Go from having
nothing set up to a complete deployment of JupyterHub in the cloud.
To begin this comprehensive walkthrough, the next step on your journey is
to :ref:`create a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud <google-cloud>`.

Customization Guide
-------------------

JupyterHub can be configured and customized to fit a variety of deployment
requirements. If you'd like to know how to expand and customize your jupyterhub setup, such
as increasing the computational resources available to users or changing authentication
services, check out the sections below. See the :ref:`helm-chart-schema` for a semi-complete
list of fields you can configure with your helm chart.

Institutional support
---------------------

This guide and the `associated helm chart <https://github.com/jupyterhub/helm-chart>`_
would not be possible without the amazing institutional support from the following
organizations (and the organizations that support them!)

* `UC Berkeley Data Science Division <http://data.berkeley.edu/>`_
* `Berkeley Institute for Data Science <https://bids.berkeley.edu/>`_
* `Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo <http://www.calpoly.edu/>`_
* `Simula Research Institute <https://www.simula.no/>`_
